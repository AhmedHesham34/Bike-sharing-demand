# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
#### AHMED HESHAM

## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
TODO: that i must remove the negative values

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
TODO: The model with hyperparameters

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
TODO: adding more features helps in increasing the score and getting more accurate predictions

### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
TODO: A lot better, because the model had more features to train

## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
TODO: better than the previous one.(0.477)

### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
TODO: in choosing the correct hyper parameters

### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.
(It is done in the notebook code)

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.
(It is done in the notebook code)
TODO: Replace the image below with your own.

### Create a line plot showing the top kaggle score for the three (or more) prediction submissions during the project.
(It is done in the notebook code)



## Summary
TODO: overall what i learned is that feature engineering is very important as it changed the score of the model and also the hyper parameters are very good as it improved the score more.
